There is a difference.-->  Her father is country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]. She held minor roles in the television series ''[[Doc (TV series)|Doc]]'' and the film ''[[Big Fish]]'' in her childhood. In 2006, Cyrus rose to prominence as a [[teen idol]] after being cast in the [[Disney Channel]] television series ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', in which she portrayed the starring character [[Miley Stewart]]. After signing a recording contract with [[Hollywood Records]] in 2007, Cyrus released her debut [[studio album]] ''[[Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus|Meet Miley Cyrus]]''. It was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for exceeding four million shipments, and produced the hit single \"[[See You Again (Miley Cyrus song)|See You Again]]\".\n\nIn 2008, Cyrus released her second album ''[[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|Breakout]]'', which featured the successful track \"[[7 Things]]\", and launched her film career as the voice actress in the animated film ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]''. In 2009, Cyrus starred in the feature film ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]''; its [[Hannah Montana: The Movie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] produced the hit single \"[[The Climb (song)|The Climb]]\". Cyrus developed a maturing image with the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Time of Our Lives (EP)|The Time of Our Lives]]'' (2009), which featured the successful track \"[[Party in the U.S.A.]]\". The transition continued with her third album ''[[Can't Be Tamed]]'' (2010); however, it made little commercial impact and became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Cyrus starred in the [[coming-of-age film]] ''[[The Last Song (film)|The Last Song]]''. During its production, she was involved in an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with her co-star [[Liam Hemsworth]]; the couple ultimately separated after ending their year-long engagement in 2013.\n\nCyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances throughout 2011 and 2012. Cyrus later signed a recording contract with [[RCA Records]], and generated controversy by cultivating a sexually explicit public image while promoting her fourth studio album ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013). Its singles \"[[We Can't Stop]]\" and \"[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]\" were promoted with controversial music videos; the latter became her first number-one hit on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nCyrus has had five non-consecutive number-one albums on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], two of which are soundtracks credited to her titular character [[Miley Stewart|Hannah Montana]], and has earned numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Miley Cyrus|awards and nominations]]. In 2010, Cyrus ranked number thirteen on ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''{{'}} [[Celebrity 100]], and was named the \"Most Charted Teenager\" in the 2011 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' with twenty-nine ''Billboard'' Hot 100 entries as of November 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=#13 Miley Cyrus|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/53/celeb-100-10_Miley-Cyrus_EB0C.html|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=April 5, 2014|date=June 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Michael Jackson make 'Guinness World Records 2011'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/lady-gaga-jayz-michael-jackson-make-guinness-world-records-2011-2081230.html|publisher=''The Independent''|accessdate=April 5, 2014|date=September 16, 2010|location=London}}</ref> In 2013, she was declared \"Artist of the Year\" by [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Press |first=Associated |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/09/mtv-declares-miley-cyrus-its-artist-of-the-year/ |title=MTV declares Miley Cyrus its artist of the year |publisher=''The San Diego Union-Tribune'' |date=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1992\u20132005: Early life and career beginnings===\nDestiny Hope Cyrus was born on November 23, 1992, in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], a suburb of Nashville, to Letitia Jean \"Tish\" Finley Cyrus and country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Miley Cyrus Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/miley-cyrus.html|publisher=The Biography Channel|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref> She grew up on a {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in Franklin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garibaldi|first=Christina|title=Miley Cyrus Loves Weed, Thinks Kids Are 'Mean' And Doesn't Give A 'Sh--'|url=http://m.mtv.com/news/article.rbml?id=1721672|publisher=MTV News.

However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] ''ris'', which comes from Italian ''riso'', in turn from the [[Latin]] ''oriza'', which derives from the Greek \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1 (''oruza''). The Greek word is the source of all European words (cf. Welsh ''reis'', German ''Reis'', Lithuanian ''ry\u017eiai'', Serbo-Croatian ''ri\u017ea'', Polish ''ry\u017c'', Dutch ''rijst'', Hungarian ''rizs'', Romanian ''orez'').<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=rice rice], Online Etymology Dictionary</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=rice | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] | accessdate=March 13, 2014 | edition=English, online | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rice }}</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fruza \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>\n\nThe origin of the Greek word is unclear.

Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for ''[[risotto]]'' in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'', in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in [[amylopectin]], known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|title=White Sticky Rice \u2013 Kao Niow|author=Loha-unchit, Kasma |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref> A stickier medium-grain rice is used for ''[[sushi]]''; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batter]]s and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Kome.JPG|thumb|Milled to unmilled rice, from left to right, [[:en:White rice|white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'', rice with [[:en:Cereal germ|germ]], [[:en:Brown rice|brown rice]]]]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess starch. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste rice.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate germination. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),<ref>{{cite web | title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread| url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html | accessdate=February 12, 2004|author=Shoichi Ito and Yukihiro Ishikawa|publisher=Tottori University, Japan. }}</ref> activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\n===Processing===\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water similar to the volume of rice. With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in Iran and Afghanistan or [[biryani]] ([[Dam-pukhtak]]) in India and Pakistan.\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Medieval Islamic texts spoke of medical uses for the plant.<ref>[[#Watson|Watson]], p. 15</ref> Rice may also be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge, fawrclaab, okayu, Xifan, jook, or rice gruel) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Nutrition and health==\n\n===Nutrients and the nutritional importance of rice===\n{{Nutritional value\n| image = [[File:Rice p1160004.jpg|200px]]\n| name=Rice, white, long-grain, raw\n| Scientific Name = ''[[Oryza sativa]]''\n| water=11.61 g\n| kJ=1527\n| protein=7.13 g\n| fat=0.66 g\n| carbs=80 g\n| sugars=0.12 g\n| fiber=1.3 g\n| vitB6 =0.164mg\n| iron_mg=0.80\n| manganese_mg=1.088\n| calcium_mg=28\n| magnesium_mg=25\n| phosphorus_mg=115\n| potassium_mg=115\n| zinc_mg=1.09\n| pantothenic_mg=1.014\n| vitB6_mg=0.164\n| folate_[[ug]]=8\n| thiamin_mg=0.0701\n| riboflavin_mg=0.0149\n| niacin_mg=1.62\n| source_usda=1\n}}\n\nRice is the staple food of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.

It depends on the strain of rice, that is between white, brown, black, red and purple varieties of rice \u2013 each prevalent in different parts of the world. It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice in human nutrition|year=1993|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|author=Juliano, Bienvenido O. |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0567E/T0567E00.htm}}</ref>\n\nAn illustrative comparison between white and brown rice of protein quality, mineral and vitamin quality, carbohydrate and fat quality suggests that neither is a complete nutrition source.

Scientific studies suggest that these color pigments have antioxidant properties that may be useful to human health. In purple rice bran, hydrophilic antioxidants are in greater quantity and have higher free radical scavenging activity than lipophilic antioxidants. Anthocyanins and \u03b3-tocols in purple rice are largely located in the inner portion of purple rice bran.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lipophilic and Hydrophilic Antioxidants and Their Antioxidant Activities in Purple Rice Bran|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=57|issue=3|year=2009|pages=858\u2013862|doi=10.1021/jf803113c|author=Jang, Sungjoon and Xu, Zhimin |pmid=19138081}}</ref>\n\nComparative nutrition studies on [[red rice|red]], [[black rice|black]] and white varieties of rice suggest that pigments in red and black rice varieties may offer nutritional benefits. Red or black rice consumption was found to reduce or retard the progression of atherosclerotic plaque development, induced by dietary cholesterol, in mammals. White rice consumption offered no similar benefits, and the study claims this to be due to absent antioxidants in red and black varieties of rice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Red and Black Rice Decrease Atherosclerotic Plaque Formation and Increase Antioxidant Status in Rabbits|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=131|issue=5|year=2001|pages=1421\u20131426|pmid=11340093|last1=Ling|first1=WH|last2=Cheng|first2=QX|last3=Ma|first3=J|last4=Wang|first4=T}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison of rice to other major staple foods===\nThe table below shows the nutrient content of major staple foods in a raw form.

[[Asian people|Asian]] farmers still account for 87% of the world's total rice production.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nRice is the staple food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as \"Maha\", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as \"Yala\", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent.\n\nTraditional rice varieties are now making a comeback with the recent interest in green foods.\n\n====Thailand====\nRice is the main export of Thailand, especially the white jasmine rice 105 (Dok Mali 105).<ref>The genetic wonder of Thai rice, 1998</ref> Thailand has a large number of rice varieties, 3,500 kinds with different characters, and 5 kinds of wild rice cultivates.<ref>Science and technology with Thai rice, National center for genetic engineering, 2003</ref> In each region of the country there are different rice seed types.

The farmers\u2019 usual crop is non-glutinous rice <ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998\"/> such as Niew Sun Pah Tong rice seeds. This rice is naturally protected from leaf disease, and the paddy has a brown color.<ref>Punkhao (Niew San Pah Tong), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref> The northeastern region has a large area, where farmers can cultivate about 36 million square meters of rice.

The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.\n\n=== Middle East ===\nRice was grown in some areas of southern Iraq.

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantation]]s around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as \"Carolina Gold.\" The [[cultivar]] has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop.<ref>[http://www.carolinagoldricefoundation.org/ Carolina Gold Rice Foundation].

A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]], is subjected to a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. This causes nutrients from the outer husk, especially [[thiamine]], to move into the grain itself. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\nDespite the hypothetical health risks of talc (such as stomach cancer),<ref>[http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/cosmetics/talc.htm Risks of Talcum Powder]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}. Preventcancer.com. Retrieved on May 13, 2012.</ref><ref>Thomas, Jo (February 7, 1981). [http://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/us/talc-coating-on-rice-called-peril.html Talc coating on rice called peril]. NewYorkTimes.com.</ref> talc-coated rice remains the norm in some countries due to its attractive shiny appearance, but it has been banned in some, and is no longer widely used in others (such as the United States). Even where talc is not used, glucose, starch, or other coatings may be used to improve the appearance of the grains.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]]. Rice flour does not contain [[gluten]], so is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]]. Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Japan]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as paddy (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labour groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of moulds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008) ''From Parastatals to Private Trade''.

While there are numerous importers of rice, the exporters of rice are limited.

Some nematode species such as ''Pratylenchus'' spp. are most dangerous in upland rice of all parts of the world. Rice root nematode (''[[Hirschmanniella oryzae]]'') is a migratory endoparasite which on higher inoculum levels will lead to complete destruction of a rice crop. Beyond being obligate parasites, they also decrease the vigor of plants and increase the plants' susceptibility to other pests and diseases.\n\n=== Other Pests ===\nThese include: the apple snail  ''[[Pomacea canaliculata]]'', [[panicle rice mite]], [[rat]]s,<ref>Singleton G, Hinds L, Leirs H and Zhang Zh (Eds.)

The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.<ref name=j2/> Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kogan, M.; Ortman, E.F. |title=Antixenosis a new term proposed to defined to describe Painter's \"non-preference\" modality of resistance |journal=Bull.

When a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down. Rice varieties that can be widely grown for many years in the presence of pests and retain their ability to withstand the pests are said to have durable resistance.

There are four major categories of rice worldwide: [[Indica rice|indica]], [[japonica rice|japonica]], [[Aromatic rice|aromatic]] and [[glutinous rice|glutinous]]. The different varieties of rice are not considered interchangeable, either in food preparation or agriculture, so as a result, each major variety is a completely separate market from other varieties.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005|work=Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html?referrer=email }}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice.

This project enabled labor markets in Asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors. The first \"Rice Car\", IR8 was produced in 1966 at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] which is based in the Philippines at the [[University of the Philippines]]' Los Ba\u00f1os site. IR8 was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee Geo Woo Gen.\"<ref name=\"ir8\">{{Wayback |date=20060713032524 |url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |title=Rice Varieties }}.

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence. Ongoing research in China to develop [[perennial rice]] could result in enhanced sustainability and [[food security]].\n\n=== Golden rice ===\n{{Main|Golden rice}}\nRice kernels do not contain [[vitamin A]], so people who obtain most of their calories from rice are at risk of [[vitamin A deficiency]]. German and Swiss researchers have [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] rice to produce [[beta-carotene]], the precursor to vitamin A, in the rice kernel. The beta-carotene turns the processed (white) rice a \"gold\" color, hence the name \"golden rice.\" The beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in humans who consume the rice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/PDFs/ASNonGR.pdf |title=Researchers Determine That Golden Rice Is an Effective Source of Vitamin A |publisher=[[American Society for Nutrition]] |year=2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2010 }}</ref> Although some rice strains produce beta-carotene in the hull, no non-genetically engineered strains have been found that produce beta-carotene in the kernel, despite the testing of thousands of strains.
